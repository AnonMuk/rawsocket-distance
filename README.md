## Usage:
Please include a `targets.txt` file in the same folder as the script.
`python distMeasurement.py`
The script will either append results to the end of `results.csv` or create the file if it does not exist.

## Execution Notes:
tmall.com, nih.gov, businessinsider.com, medicalnewstoday.com, superuser.com, and oschina.net did not respond.

I am using youtube.com, onlinevideoconverter.com, 1337x.to, znds.com, wildberries.ru, crunchyroll.com, and indiamart.com to replace them
